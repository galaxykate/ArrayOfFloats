You may wish to use this in your own class! 
Making a new output module (like the face of flower, use those as templates) would be a great assignment.  I'll try to make it increasingly straightforward in the future, too.

 It's Apache licensed, so use it however you wish.  I do love hearing about new uses, so drop me a line on twitter @galaxykate if you do!
